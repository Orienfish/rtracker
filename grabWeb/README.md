## How to fetch the content of a website
There is a short piece Javascript code to do this. The only thing need to know is we need to use [AllOrigins](http://multiverso.me/AllOrigins/) to avoid CORS error.

See [reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/client-side-web-scraping-with-javascript-using-jquery-and-regex-5b57a271cb86).

[How to Set Up a Local Web Server](https://www.maketecheasier.com/setup-local-web-server-all-platforms/) is a tutorial on setting up Apache2. We may need to set up a fixed webpage this week. Now I have copied the paragraph we used in user testing to [http://137.110.160.230](http://137.110.160.230). But for some weird reasons I can't fetch content from it right now. Will be appreciated if any of you have a look at it.
